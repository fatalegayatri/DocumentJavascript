            JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time
            compiled programming language with first-class functions. While it
            is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many
            non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache
            CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat.

          <p class="second">
            JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded,
            dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and
            declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.

          <h1>Java and JavaScript</h1>
          <p>
            JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally
            different in some others. The JavaScript language resembels Java but
            deos not jave Java's static typing and strong type checking.
            JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions
            and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was
            renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript
          </p>
          <p>
            In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by
            declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small
            number of data typesrepresenting numeric, Boolean, and string
            values. JavaScript jas a prototype-based object model instead of the
            more common class-based objectmodel. The prototype-based model
            provides dynamic in inheritance; that is,what is inherited can vary
            for individual objects. JavaScriptalso supports funcitons without
            any special declarative requirements. Fuctions can be properties of
            object , executing as loosely typed methods.

            To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and
            write your first<q>Hello World</q> javascript code

          <div class="function">
            fuction greetMe(yourName ) {

            alert("Hello "+yourName); } <br />
